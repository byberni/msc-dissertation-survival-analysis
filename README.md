# SURVIVAL ANALYSIS AFTER PERMANENT PACEMAKER IMPLANTATION FOR PATIENTS WITH CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES



**Keywords:** survival analysis, cardiovascular diseases, Kaplan Meier, Cox model.


### I. Motivation
One of the modern and effective methods of treating cardiovascular diseases is the installation of a pacemaker. However, for cardiologists, the question arises in assessing the average survival rate of patients after an appropriate operation to install a stimulator, in our case, in the presence of sick sinus syndrome (SSNS) in patients.

### II. Problem
This work provided survival analysis for patients with cardiovascular diseases after permanent pacemaker implantation in a four-year perspective. The Cox model showed which predictor has an influence on mortality.

### III. Key Results 
As part of this work, the following tasks were completed:
1. A methodology has been developed to estimate the survival function taking into account the influence of control variables.
2. An experimental design has been developed for statistical assessments of survival functions for patients with SSSS.
3. Signs that influence the risk of death in the long term have been selected.
4. A survival model was developed taking into account the selected characteristics.
5. Information support has been developed for assessing death risk multipliers.




### IV. Content
Based on the constructed Cox proportional hazards model, the following conclusions were made:
* age increases the risk of death by an average of 1.06 times;
* myocardial infarction increases the risk of death by an average of 2.92 times (taking into account a confidence level of 95%, confidence interval - from 1.62 to 5.24 times);
* the presence of diabetes mellitus increases the risk of death by 3.3 times, and taking into account the 95% confidence level, the confidence interval is from 1.67 to 6.51 times;
* stimulation mode A reduces the risk of death by an average of 0.44 times;
* third type of SSSU - 2.7 times (taking into account a confidence probability of 95%, confidence interval - from 1.56 to 4.67 times).
